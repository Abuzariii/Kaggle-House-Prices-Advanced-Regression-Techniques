# Kaggle-House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

**I have implemented all the core methods you need to preprocess a large dataset and then used the Linear Regression model.**

**The dataset can be downloaded [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)**

**This notebook is divided into 5 portions:**

### `1. Pandas Profiling :`
I used the built in Pandas Profiling to generate a profiling report in Colab Notebook.

### `2. Feature Selection :`
Feature selection was done based on missing values, feature correlation and Backward Elimination. All these methods are described briefly.

### `3. Data Preprocessing :`
Missing values were filled using mean and categorical columns were coded using cat.code.

### `4. Visualiztion :`
Just a trivial visualization of the value distribution among all the columns.

### `5. Modeling :`
A Linear Regression model was used to fit the preprocessed data and then then I used Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error as evaluation methods.

## **Spoiler Alert: Mean Absolute Error stood at 21k against an average Sale Price value of 180k.**
